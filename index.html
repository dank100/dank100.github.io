            <p>I took contact to a local entrepreneur in Hedensted, who was in need of a digitalized wage system. The

            <p> In my time at SuperBrugsen Hedensted, have I experienced multiple promotions, starting as a service
                employee. After four months was I promoted to the Service desk, and later a full-time contract. Doing my
                education at HTX, I managed to work
                15 hours a week. Separated from my work I developed a platform, allowing Superbrugsen to digitally share
                product deals on screens within the store. I built this system as a simple static web page with
                Javascript. SuperBrugsen is still
                using this system today.
