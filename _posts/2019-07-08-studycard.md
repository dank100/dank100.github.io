I have now applied for my UTS Student ID Card. 

The Card has been approved and a preview can be seen in the image below.

The card allows me entrance to the buildings and facilities of the University of Technology Sydney. This includes the computer labs, library and the social clubs of UTS. The ActivateUTS is an organization arranging event throughout the semester, such as surfing camps and football practices.
