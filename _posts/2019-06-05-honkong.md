---

My Bachelor project has been accepted to MDM 2019. 

"The MDM series of conferences, since its debut in 1999, has established itself as a prestigious forum for the exchange of innovative and significant research results in mobile data management".

In 2019 is the conference held in Hong Kong at the Department of Computer Science of Hong Kong Baptist University. Unfortunately will I not attend the conference due to exams throughout June, however, my supervisor Bin Yang, will attend on the behalf of Me and my group. The poster he will display is simple and shown here:

In order, to be accepted at such a conference a number of reviews must acknowledge the "Strong Points" of your application. 
One of the reviews state list following strong points: Delivery route planning is an important problem. The whole infrastructure of the system is well introduced. Each of the components is well designed.

All reviews resulted in a recommended accept.
