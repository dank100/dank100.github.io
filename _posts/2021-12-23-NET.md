Starting from the new year will I be employed at Norlys Energi Trading. I am looking forward to the challenge! Working with an in-house project, where I will participate in the evolution of navigating the Energi market in collaboration with skilled traders and analytics.

The goal in NET (Norlys Energi Trading) is to provide better energy pricing for our customers in NORLYS. By navigating the market, will we be able to reduce our carbon footprint by priorities the green energy available on the market.

In my education at <a href="/aau">Aalborg University</a>, have I been specializing in modelling and verification, to which I hope to apply my expertise in the energy sector. Modelling parts of the market will help us navigate the market and see opportunities to achieve even greater values.
