This is more a practical blog post than the priors. 

I have found a person to whom I'm sub-letting my room in Aalborg, in the period 1st August until 1st February. I have now emptied my room and is ready to leave Denmark and experience the new environment offered in Sydney, Australia.

I'm leaving the 10th of July to Hong Kong, in Hong Kong I'm looking to experience the culture of a city hosting millions of people with different nationalities. While in Hong Kong, I'm also expecting to go to Shenzen, which is very much acknowledged as the tech capital of the world. 

Shenzen, China is a city build about the possibilities to provide hardware to the tech-world. Meaning that many large tech and software companies have a large office in this city. Shenzen is also home for a large portion of start-up companies trying to produce the perfect product before exposing it to the world. In Shenzen, I'm expecting to see and experience the possibilities to design and produce your own Software-based product, in a fast and economical way.

I will arrive in Sydney on the 20th of July, where I will spend the first couple of days to find accommodation and learn the whereabouts of Sydney. As the map suggests UTS is located in the very center of the city. I will, however, try to find accommodation between UTS and Bondi. Such that I'll be living around Paddington and Woollahra.
