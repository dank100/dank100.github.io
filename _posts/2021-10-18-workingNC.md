Through my position at Netcompany have I achieved a greater understanding of working in smaller teams utilizing SAFe. Our project is a Java application with Spring Boot and Groovy to support the REST-based application part, with Maven as a build tool.

In total my project employees around 100 consultants, where I am part of a smaller solution, Offsetting. Offsetting is an integrated part of the Oracle based solution PSRM, to which we allow caseworkers to offset debtors in a REACT based web application, interacting with Offsetting and PSRM.
