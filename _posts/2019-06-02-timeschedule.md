I have now got my 24 credit points. The courses that I have been enrolled in are:

I'm very excited to have all of the courses, as more of them seem to be an extension to courses thought at Aalborg University. I have previously been thought Database systems and Internet Technologies, that both contains very interesting technologies.

The courses are scheduled as in the time table below. Very distinct from Aalborg University, does UTS schedule their courses through the whole day, where the earliest element is 9:30 AM and the latest being 7:30 PM.

Blue is the Lectures, where red means computer lab and green is a group discussion.
