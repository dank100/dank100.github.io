title: Vacation in Hongkong before University start July the 22nd
---

My vacation in Hong Kong and Shenzhen has been an incredible trip with time to visit Hong Kong and southern China, Shenzhen.

Before I arrive in Sydney and attend University of Technology Sydney (UTS), I have taken the time to visit Hongkong as a short summer vacation. As of Aalborg University, the summer break is from 1st of July until the 1st of September, at UTS the semester starts on the 22nd of July. 

The city of Hong Kong has so much to offer! I have experienced some amazing areas of Hong Kong, such as the Victoria Peak, from where you are able to glimpse the amazing skyline. The skyscrapers of this city extend as far as the eye can see.

When not looking at the overwhelming skyline, you can find other beautiful areas. The pictures below show the none industrial and calm part of the Hongkong river with and a beautiful nature sight to the other side of the Victoria Peak. In Hong Kong, you don't have to travel far to get out of the busy city.

Hong Kong is known to be one of the densest populated cities in the world. Even though the pictures above show a calm and spacious Hong Kong, there also exists areas very dense as the picture below shows. Here the apartments merely see the sun and you can only imagine how many apartments there are hidden in these buildings.

Besides visiting Hong kong, have I also moved my belongings and address from Aalborg back to my childhood home.
