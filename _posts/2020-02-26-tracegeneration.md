Study of Network trace generation from Weighted Pushdown Automata. 
The scope of this project is to extend the existing AalWiNes with trace generation in a network. It will further extend the network with weights represented in Weighted Pushdown automata. The thesis presents a formal definition of a weighted extension to the existing pushdown automata definition.
