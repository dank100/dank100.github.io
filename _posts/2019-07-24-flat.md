title: My flat in Sydney
---

After some time living in hostels across Sydney, and a bunch of flat inspections, I have now managed to find a private room in a shared flat.

The flat is located in Kensington near the University of New South Wales (UNSW), which is not the university I attend. I have bought a bike that allows me a 15-minute bike ride across Sydney, to get to UTS. The flat is in very good condition and shared with 5 other people. We share two bathrooms and a kitchen-living area, shown in the pictures below.

My room is one of the smallest with a price of $250 per week.

At the university, we are currently having our first week, and thus the introduction to all of the courses. I will make another blog post for these once we get into the theory. 

P.S the Australian accent is coming along.

Cheers, Dan.
