title: My time abroad has come to an end
---


Advanced database, Advanced Internet Programming, and Advanced Analytics Algorithms were all extensions to existing subjects at AAU and gave me an even broader understanding of the fields. 
Innovation, Creativity & Entrepreneurship is a postgraduate subject at the business faculty of UTS. The business-course gave me a great understanding for a new dimension of knowledge.
