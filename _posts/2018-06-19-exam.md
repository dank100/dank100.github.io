An aSTEP application with a greedy heuristic approach to thecapacitated vehicle routing problem.

<a href="https://astep.cs.aau.dk">aSTEP</a> is a spatio-temporal data manage-ment and analytics platform, that aimsto help developers build their own locationbased services.aSTEP is a collaborativeand inherited project that spans over abachelor semester at Aalborg University.The project is distributed between multi-ple groups that each have individual, aswell as collaborative, responsibility for fea-tures of aSTEP. 

The aSTEP feature ofthis report concerns the Logistics solution,which allows a freight forwarder to re-ceive routes to a given workload list input.The solution is implemented using the sav-ings algorithm, and Large NeighborhoodSearch to optimize the routes from the sav-ings algorithm.  To be able to calculatethe routes of the workload list, the algo-rithm needs to know the duration betweenthe set of locations relevant for the work-load.  Durations are calculated throughOpen Source Routing Machine, which usesMulti Level Dijkstra to calculate durationsbased on data provided by Open StreetMap.  To ease development, ContinuousIntegration has been set up through Git-Lab Runner.  Depending on the project,the CI setup deploys either to Artifactoryor GitLab Container Registry. To host thefront-end, a script has been implementedto pull and deploy the latest content fromthe Registry.
