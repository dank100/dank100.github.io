I am employeed at Netcompany Aalborg from August the 3rd. I'm looking forward to the oppertunity to work at a firm of this magnitude. 
I will pursue the oppertunity to work as a Software Architect, thus, experience the usage of a wide range of frameworks and tools. My first task will be at the Aalborg office, however, will I be relocated to the Amsterdam office once my first project is due and my onboarding phase has terminated. 
My first impressions of the job will soon be available.
