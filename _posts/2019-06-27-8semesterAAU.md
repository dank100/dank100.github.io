The University I will attend is UTS (University of Technology Sydney), according to <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/university/facts-figures-and-rankings/ratings-and-rankings">QS University Ranking 2020</a> is UTS ranked as the 140 best in the world and within the 100 bests of Computer Science.

I'm very excited that I have just a single exam left at Aalborg University, namely the Master Thesis, which is due Spring 2020. I'm looking forward to my next semester in Sydney, I will try to keep you updated in the University of Technology Sydney tab of this blog.
