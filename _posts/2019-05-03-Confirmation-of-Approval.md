<div class="language" language="en-US">It finally happende, I recieved my CoE (Confirmation of Enrolment) from UTS.

<img class="float-right" width="400" src="/images/UTS.png"/>

This means that I now have an official UTS mail address and login to their intern system.
Alongside the CoE, I also recieved a listed of assesed subjects from UTS.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/images/subjects.png"/>

Next step is to get a spot in 24 credits worth of points.

Untill next time!
